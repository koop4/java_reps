# java_reps
Used to helping a mate understanding java concept and solving university exercises

# How it works
Each excercise has a folder containing both the .java and .class files.

# Requirement
It is mandatory to install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html
You can also install a Java Development Kit (JDK) which contain a JRE.
To check if you already have it, type in your terminal:
`java -v`

E.G: `robdll@robdll-N55SF:~/Documents/other/java/java_reps$ java -version`
openjdk version "1.8.0_111"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-8u111-b14-2u

# Running a program
Open your shell, move to the directory containing the program and type:
`java programName`

E.G. `robdll@robdll-N55SF:~/GitRepositories/java/java_reps/es1$ java SpaceReader`     


# Note
In some excercises there could be only a version. Other time you'll notice 2 .java in the same folder.
I decided to make an ugly version, and  a better version to explain how a clean code can make the difference.
